# agent-studio-essentials

Customer-facing lab guide for Agent Studio Essentials, served via GitHub
Pages.

## Visibility contract: designed public

This repo is **designed public from its first commit**. It may sit at
Internal visibility while awaiting admin promotion, but every commit must
already meet the public bar:

- No secrets, tokens, keys, or credentials — ever, in any commit.
- No internal URLs (Okta, Confluence, Slack, private Pages domains).
- No employee GitHub usernames or internal names in content or metadata.
- Customer-facing register only. Authoring discussion happens
  elsewhere; issues are disabled here on purpose.

There is no safe way to scrub a public repo after the fact — force-pushed
commits stay reachable by SHA. If something internal lands here, treat it as
leaked: rotate any credential and involve the org admin.

## What lives here

Pressed static output only (HTML from the Gutenberg press), under `docs/` —
the GitHub Pages source folder (main branch, /docs). Source manuscripts,
decisions records, and screenshots-in-progress live in the internal
authoring repo. Do not edit lab HTML in place — re-press and replace the
whole set. This repo receives curated snapshots only: all iteration,
discussion, and issue tracking happen in the internal authoring repo, so
nothing internal ever accumulates in this repo's history or PR threads.

## Gates

- `.github/workflows/publish-guard.yml` runs the pre-publish checks on every
  push.
- `.githooks/pre-push` runs the same checks locally
  (`git config core.hooksPath .githooks` once per clone).

## Working in this repo

Never commit or push directly to `main` after the initial curated commit —
it is the published surface (GitHub Pages serves `main:/docs`), so a push to
main is a deploy. All work after repo birth lands via branch + pull request,
matching the authoring repo's regime. Before merging: rebase the branch onto
main, then run the scrubber (`scripts/publish-checks.sh`) on the rebased
result — CI repeats the same scrub on every push and PR.
